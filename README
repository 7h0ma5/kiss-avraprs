This is a project that combines code from a number of sources into a,
hopefully, working and useful KISS TNC.

Thanks to BertOS, KI4MCW and OM5AMX, without whom I probably wouldn't have
been able to do this.
Starting with the BertOS example for AVR, KI4MCW made excellent progress
before turning to the Parallax Propeller.  I wanted to stick with the AVR
so I looked at other projects that used BertOS and happened across OM5AMX's
work on the Cortex-M3.  Michal's KISS implementation is more complete than
Rob had created so far.

The work I've done is mostly limited to merging the KISS implementation with
Rob's modifications to the original BertOS example code.  Original code is
available from the code below:

I've added PTT output on PB3 / Arduino D11, LED strobe output on PB4 / D12
when the DAC code is running, in addition to the LED strobe on PB5 / D13 when
the ADC is running.


Problems, bugs, things to fix...

On Uno, the code does not transmit. I haven't investigated why the two boards
differ or why the code runs differently on them.

Due to the limited RAM space on the ATmega 328P there are some limitations:
	The serial buffer is 330 bytes.
	The AFSK TX/RX buffers are 64 bytes each.
This probably will not work well as a full-fledged KISS TNC!
